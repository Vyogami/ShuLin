# Overview

- We will be using GTK4 + Libadwaita with python bindings as everyone is familiar with python and since we are not using tauri so our other option will be to build it in [Nextron(Next + Electron)](https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron) which is just bloat and immature!
- We will develop it after the architecture of backend is ready and the UI mockup is finished.

## Some references for gtk4 + python

- [Introduction to GTK4 in python](https://github.com/Taiko2k/GTK4PythonTutorial/tree/main) - this is a good starting point to get familiar with widget and development process of gtk4 + libadwaita in general.
- [GTK4-Python official documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- [GTK4 Widget gallery](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/visual_index.html)
- [Adwaita widget gallery](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/widget-gallery.html)
- Get familiar with [Gnome Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder)
  - [Documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/introduction/builder.html) - there are no tutorial available but the documentation is really nice.
- We will be using [Cambalache](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jpu/cambalache) or [Glade](https://github.com/GNOME/glade) for UI designing, i prefer cambalache!
  - [Glade documentation](https://help.gnome.org/users/glade/stable/)
