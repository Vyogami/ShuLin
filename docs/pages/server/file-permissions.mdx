# File Permissions

## How mode is calculated

`rwx` => 4+ 2 + 1 = 7
`r--` => 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
`r-x` => 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

So, if a file has permissions like so
`rwx r-x r-x`

- The mode is `755`
- The 3 parts correspond to root, group and user permissions respectively 

This will be used in very single route mentioned in this file

## GET get-perms

```md
 {{server}}/get-perms
```

- Route to get the permissions of a file
- Returns the mode of said file
- 404 if file does not exist or the server is not running on superuser privileges 

```json
{
	path: "/home/blon/somefile.txt"
}
```

## POST set-perms

```md
 {{server}}/set-perms
```

- Route to set the permissions of a file
- Expects a uint mode
- If default mode is not provided, `400` is assumed
- `404 NOT FOUND `if file does not exist or the server is not running on superuser privileges 

```json
{
	path: "/home/blon/somefile.txt"
	mode: 755
}
```
